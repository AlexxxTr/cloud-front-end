# Cloud Front End

This is the front end for the cloud and edge computing course. It is made with Vue x Vite. Vite is a build tool that helps you develop your apps fast. I have noticed this when creating the app and found it's quick reload feature very nice to work with. Vue was again a bit of learning but after some time I got the hang of it again, and found that Vue is actually very nice to work with. I would certainly do some more project with this framework.
